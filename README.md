# Introduction
Hi! I'm Mohammed Alshamrani, a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
I’m eager to deepen my understanding of modern software maintenance practices, especially in areas like refactoring, modularization, and system evolution. Through this course, I also hope to gain practical experience in analyzing and improving legacy systems, transforming outdated architectures into more maintainable and efficient solutions.
